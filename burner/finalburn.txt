                              Final Burn
                   ---------------------------------

Basics!
-------
                   Final Burn is an arcade emulator.
 It requires the rom images of the original arcade machines to emulate them.
            Final Burn is free for non-commercial use only.
        The current web-page for Final Burn is www.finalburn.com

What's new?

v0.516
+ Doh - was missing two Cpu Y program roms. G-Loc runs a tiny bit better now
  (still no tilt or line sprites though of course).
+ Fixed address range on maths chip (Thunderblade random collisions)
  Many thanks to Olivier for the info.

v0.515
+ Added a bit of road emulation to Thunderblade, but it's unfinished and
  doesn't work in After Burner yet.
+ Added Royal Ascot 2 driver. Note it doesn't get past the memory check, and it's
  not really a playable game anyway (it's a gambling game thing).
* Switched DDSOM to European (parent) set
+ Fixed road palette on Out Run (e.g. stage 2B)
+ Simplified After Burner hardware cpu emulation slightly.

v0.514
+ Improved Galaxy Force hardware cpu emulation slightly.
  Power Drift sprites glitches reduced.
+ Added a general cpu 'sleep' algorithm which increases the frame rate of Rail Chase
  a little bit.
- Strike Fighter cockpit (line sprites) has disappeared (?!) no idea why.
+ Changed keyboard support so it doesn't require DirectX 5 to run, only
  normal function calls.
  This means Final Burn should now run on just about any version of DirectX
  and so should work on Windows NT too.

NOTE: This means that keyboard input codes have changed so if you have used
  games in Final Burn before you will have them configured for old key codes.
  To fix this either delete the config files in the 'cfg' sub-directory.

  Or load your game, click Input, and click Defaults.

v0.511
+ Added .DAT file export to the system menu

Using Final Burn
------------------
Put the romsets (zipped) in the subdirectory (folder) called "roms".

Note: the emulator colors will appear wrong if your desktop is in 256-color (8-bit).
Right-click on your desktop, properties, settings, and raise you color depth to 16-bit or higher
before you run the emulator.

Now Run the emulator and select your game, click Load, pick the game you wish to play.

To Configure Input
------------------
Press Input to bring up the input list.
Then double-click on an input, and press a new key for it.
